How to add Ckeditor5 in your Next JS, react App
#
webdev
#
ckeditor5
#
nextjs
#
react
I am creating a fresh CRA & here is my project directory

Alt Text

Before we going started, you need to add this npm package first, to install please paste the below code into your terminal.
npm i @ckeditor/ckeditor5-react
npm i @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic
create a components folder under src folder and create a Editor component under components/Editor.js & use this code
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react";

function Editor({ onChange, editorLoaded, name, value }) {
  const editorRef = useRef();
  const { CKEditor, ClassicEditor } = editorRef.current || {};

  useEffect(() => {
    editorRef.current = {
      CKEditor: require("@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react").CKEditor, // v3+
      ClassicEditor: require("@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic")
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {editorLoaded ? (
        <CKEditor
          type=""
          name={name}
          editor={ClassicEditor}
          data={value}
          onChange={(event, editor) => {
            const data = editor.getData();
            // console.log({ event, editor, data })
            onChange(data);
          }}
        />
      ) : (
        <div>Editor loading</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Editor;



Now go to your app.js or wherever you want to use this editor just import Editor Component and use this
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import "./styles.css";
import Editor from "./Editor";

export default function App() {
  const [editorLoaded, setEditorLoaded] = useState(false);
  const [data, setData] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    setEditorLoaded(true);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>ckEditor 5</h1>

      <Editor
        name="description"
        onChange={(data) => {
          setData(data);
        }}
        editorLoaded={editorLoaded}
      />

      {JSON.stringify(data)}
    </div>
  );
}

Your codesandbox has same problem as my application. When you make a change in the code, and reload error:

CKEditorError
ckeditor-duplicated-modules
Read more: ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest...
â–¶ 13 stack frames were collapsed.
eval
/src/Editor.js:10:21
7 | useEffect(() => {
8 | editorRef.current = {
9 | CKEditor: require("@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react").CKEditor, // v3+

10 | ClassicEditor: require("@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic")
| ^
11 | };
12 | }, []);
13 |

Any idea how to solve this?

finally I did it bro. try to use ckeditor by using online builder method. When you choose your plugins remember to choose base64 adapter this can help you to upload image from your computer. I have tried and success. Good luck to you bro. Note that base64 is the way you can upload image without any server-side configuration and no additional pluggin need to be installed when you use online-builder
